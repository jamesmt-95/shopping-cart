================ Types of Web Storage ================
#Local storage:
It keeps store the user information data without expiration date this data will not be deleted -
when user closed the browser windows it will be available for day, week, month and year.
Local storage can store 5-10mb offline data.

#Session Storage:
It is same like local storage date except it will delete all data when browser windows closed by a web user.
Session storage can store upto 5 mb data

#Session:
Sessions are server-side files that contain user data.
A session is a global variable stored on the server.
Each session is assigned a unique id which is used to retrieve stored values.

#Cookies:
Cookies are client-side files on a local computer that hold user information.
Cookies are data, stored in small text files as name-value pairs, on your computer.
Once a cookie has been set, all page requests that follow return the cookie name and value.

#Cache:
Almost synonymous with local storage.
It makes websites load faster by saving heavier webpage resources on your device.
Stuff stored in cache is usually static and unchanging
Examples of what cache stores are: Images (logos, background, cat pictures, etc.), Videos (you know, YouTube), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (bits of code)


#How to compare two ObjectID's in MongoDB
ObjectIDs are objects so if you just compare them with == you're comparing their references.
If you want to compare their values you need to use the ObjectID.equals method as follows:
if (results.userId.equals(AnotherMongoDocument._id)) {
    ...
}

OR

convert the object id to string(using toString() method) will do the job.
